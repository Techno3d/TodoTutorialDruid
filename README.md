# Todo App In Rust & Druid
This is the git repo for my [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEa2eq4HEU8) on making a todo app in rust!

## This guide goes through
* Setting up druid and other dependencies
* Creating the basic design of the app
* Context Menus and deleting tasks
* Saving state
* Controllers (to use enter as an input method for todos)
* Theming

## Extra challenges
* Use another format that is not JSON for saving data
* Style your app
